# Python Evaluator for Machine Learning Workflows

This project allows for the evaluation of whole machine learning workflows
specified in a simple JSON format. As such, it can be considered an extension of
the Pipeline class in scikit-learn. Moreover, it contains a simple XMLRPC
interface which allows for parallel evaluation of a number of worflows at once.

The project orgininated as part of GP-ML, a framework for the automatic design
of machine learning workflows based on genetic programming, where it was used
for the evaluation of the population in a distributed way.
